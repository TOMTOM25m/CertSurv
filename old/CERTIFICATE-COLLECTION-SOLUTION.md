# Certificate Data Collection Architecture - Solution Design

## ðŸŽ¯ PROBLEM ANALYSIS

**Current Issue:** WebService on itscmgmt03 only provides LOCAL certificates from itscmgmt03, not from all 151 servers.

**Missing Component:** Data submission mechanism from 151 servers TO the central WebService.

## ðŸš€ SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

### Method 1: Push-Based Collection (RECOMMENDED)

```
151 Servers â†’ Daily Upload â†’ itscmgmt03 WebService â†’ Client Queries
```

#### Implementation:
1. **FL-CertificateSubmission.psm1** - New module for data upload
2. **Submit-CertificateData** - Function to POST certificate data
3. **Scheduled Task** - Daily execution on all 151 servers
4. **WebService Endpoint** - `/api/submit-certificates` for receiving data

### Method 2: Pull-Based Collection (Alternative)

```
itscmgmt03 WebService â†’ Connects to 151 Servers â†’ Collects Data â†’ Serves to Clients
```

#### Implementation:
1. **Collect-AllCertificates.ps1** - Script on itscmgmt03
2. **Scheduled Task** - Daily collection from all servers
3. **WinRM/Invoke-Command** - Remote certificate scanning

## ðŸ“‹ RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Create Data Submission Module
- FL-CertificateSubmission.psm1
- Submit-CertificateData function
- POST endpoint on WebService

### Phase 2: Update WebService to Accept Data
- New /api/submit-certificates endpoint
- Certificate data storage/merging
- Database/JSON file management

### Phase 3: Deploy to All Servers
- Add submission module to deployment package
- Create scheduled tasks on all 151 servers
- Test data collection

### Phase 4: Validate End-to-End
- Verify data from all servers
- Test client queries
- Performance validation

## ðŸ”§ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Create FL-CertificateSubmission.psm1**
2. **Add POST endpoint to WebService**
3. **Test with 1-2 servers first**
4. **Scale to all 151 servers**

Should I implement the Push-Based Collection solution?
